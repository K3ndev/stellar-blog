# Here's a brief description of each service:
This project consists of two main services and a docker setup for database and clerk for auth and user management.

1. `client`: Handles the client-side user interface.
2. `server-graphql`: Manages Express with prisma and graphql.
    - make sure to get the public key from clerk then put `\n` for new line
3. `mock-db`: A docker-setup for database (postgres).
4. `auth`: clerk for handling auth and user management.
